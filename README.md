👋 Hi, I’m Ayushman Pani

I’m a Computer Science (AI & ML) undergraduate with a strong interest in building real-world machine learning and LLM-based systems, not just models that run in notebooks.

I enjoy working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Backend Engineering, and Applied AI, focusing on systems that are:

correct

explainable

production-oriented

and debuggable

🧠 What I work on

Machine Learning & Deep Learning

TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch

Classification, time-series, computer vision

Model evaluation and optimization

LLM & RAG Systems

Document Q&A and compliance assistants

LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers

FAISS-based vector search

Metadata-aware retrieval and source attribution

Backend for AI Systems

FastAPI + Uvicorn

ML model serving as APIs

File ingestion pipelines, metadata handling

Clean and modular backend architecture

Applied AI Projects

ECG signal classification (API-based)

Smart traffic monitoring using computer vision and IoT

Financial optimization and budgeting systems

YOLO-based vehicle detection and tracking

🛠 Tech Stack

Languages:
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

ML / AI:
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers

Backend & Data:
FastAPI, REST APIs, FAISS, MongoDB

Frontend & Tools:
React, Streamlit, Git, Linux/WSL, Google Colab

🚀 How I approach problems

I care about system design, not just code

I debug issues deeply instead of adding hacks

I build projects that are interview-ready and industry-aligned

I value clarity, reproducibility, and correctness

Most of my projects are built end-to-end — from data ingestion → model → API → UI.

🎯 Current goals

Build strong portfolio-grade ML & LLM projects

Improve MLOps and deployment skills

Prepare for ML/AI internships and roles at top tech companies

Learn more about security and reliability of AI systems
